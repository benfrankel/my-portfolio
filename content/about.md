Hello there! My name is **Ben Frankel**.

I love learning new things and building new things. Lately I've been learning more about computer graphics.

I run [Arch Linux] on a PC that I "built" (_I ordered the parts and screwed them together_):

- **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 5 3600
- **GPU:** XFX RX 570
- **RAM:** 16GB x2

This is my first PC. It's been pretty cool so far. I'm also using two 24" monitors suspended by a dual monitor desk mount (I didn't know this was a thing before!). More on [my setup] from the software side.

I do a lot of programming with [Rust] and [Python], but I've also worked with [C++], [C], [Go], and [Java]. I have some strong opinions on programming languages. I probably shouldn't get into it here.

Besides the boring stuff, I also like to play [Smash] \([guh-huh]) and watch [Steven Universe].
